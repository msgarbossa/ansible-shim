#
# Each Hash must contain keys for `uri` and `format`.
# URIs can point to either the local file system or remote HTTP destinations.
# - Request parameters (optional) can be included for HTTP destinations with the `params` field
#   - if the report parameter is included, the report parameter would contain the salus report
#   - when `report` is not included in params, the salus report will be located in the body of the request sent
# The available formats are `json`, `yaml`, `txt`, `sarif` and `cyclonedx-json`.
# `verbose` is an optional key and defaults to false.
# 
# Each report hash can add post parameters using the `post` key , 
# - Salus reports can be sent as a report parameter by specifying the parameter name in `salus_report_param_name`
# - additional post parameters can be specified through the `additional_params` field
#
# Each report hash can also specify what http verb should be used (currently support `put` and `post` key),
# and headers to set. 
# - If not specified http verb defaults to `post`
# - you can pass in `headers` with the corresponding list of name and value pairs.
# - Values specified with two parentheses i.e `{{VALUE}}` will be treated as an environment variable `ENV[VALUE]` while values
# specified without will be set as is. 
#
# Additional options are also available for sarif using the optional keyword: sarif_options
# The available options for the sarif_options keyword are:
# 1) `include_suppressed: true/false` -This option allows users to include/exclude suppressed/excluded results 
#    in their sarif reports. Currently this is supported for NPM audit reports
